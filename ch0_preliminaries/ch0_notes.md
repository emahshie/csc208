# Chapter 0 Notes
## What is discrete math?
- Discrete mathematics deals with functions/structures that are countable and have separate elements
- Discrete mathematics helps model real-world problems
## What are the four main topics that will be in the book?
1. Combinatorics: the theory of the ways things combine and how to count these ways
1. Sequences: ordered lists of elements
1. Symbolic logic: using symbols to represent propositions and logical connectives
1. Graph theory: using graphs to model relationships and solve problems
## What are discrete structures?
Discrete structures are mathematical objects that can represent the parts of the problems being solved
### Examples of discrete structures
Sets:
- An ordered collection of elements
- Ways to describe a set
  - Words: Let A be the set of all natural numbers less than 4
  - List: $A = {1, 2, 3}$
  - Set comprehension: $A = {x\epsilon\N:x<4}$
