# Chapter 0 Notes
## What is discrete math?
- Discrete mathematics deals with functions/structures that are countable and have separate elements
- Discrete mathematics helps model real-world problems
## What are the four main topics that will be in the book?
1. Combinatorics: the theory of the ways things combine and how to count these ways
1. Sequences: ordered lists of elements
1. Symbolic logic: using symbols to represent propositions and logical connectives
1. Graph theory: using graphs to model relationships and solve problems
## What are discrete structures?
Discrete structures are mathematical objects that can represent the parts of the problems being solved
### Examples of discrete structures
1. Sets:
  - An unordered collection of elements
  - Ways to describe a set:
    - Words
    - List 
    - Set comprehension
2. Functions:
  - A rule that assigns each input exactly one output
  - Key phrases:
    - Image: the output of the function
    - Domain: set of all inputs
    - Codomain: set of all allowable outputs
    - Range: set of all actual outputs
    - Closed formula: each output is given by a specific rule based solely on its input
    - Recursive function: computes the output based on other outputs of the function
3. Sequences:
  - An ordered collection of elements
  - Can be finite or infinite
  - Terms are refered to as $a_0, a_1, a_2, ...$
  - Can be given a closed formula by giving the function for the nth term

ex.
```math
a_n = 4n + 1
```
4. Relations:
   - How multiple elements compare to each other
   - Equal to, less than, multiple of, not equal, etc
   - Can be reflexive, symmetric, transitive, etc
5. Graphs:
   - A symmetric and irreflexive relation
   - A set of vertices together with a set of edges
