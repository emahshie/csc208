# Chapter 0 Notes
## What is discrete math?
- Discrete mathematics deals with functions/structures that are countable and have separate elements
- Discrete mathematics helps model real-world problems
## What are the four main topics that will be in the book?
1. Combinatorics: the theory of the ways things combine and how to count these ways
1. Sequences: ordered lists of elements
1. Symbolic logic: using symbols to represent propositions and logical connectives
1. Graph theory: using graphs to model relationships and solve problems
## What are discrete structures?
Discrete structures are mathematical objects that can represent the parts of the problems being solved
### Examples of discrete structures
1. Sets:
  - An ordered collection of elements
  - Ways to describe a set:
    - Words
    - List 
    - Set comprehension
1. Functions:
   - A rule that assigns each input exactly one output
   - Key phrases:
     - Image: the output of the function
     - Domain: set of all inputs
     - Codomain: set of all allowable outputs
     - Range: set of all actual outputs
     - Closed formula: each output is given by a specific rule based solely on its input
     - Recursive function: computes the output based on other outputs of the function
