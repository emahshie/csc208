# Summary
Although it is called computer SCIENCE, CS is really not a scientific discipline. The key difference between CS and science is that CS is not based on observations, just logic. There are no hypotheses in CS. Computer scientists simply make assumptions and use logic to get results. In addition, because most of CS can’t be given a definite structure, it is not a field of mathematics. In reality, CS aligns most closely with philosophy. There is no correct answer in CS, and there are an infinite number of solutions depending on how one approaches a problem. 

# Reflection
I think we were asked to read this article because it is important to understand what computer science actually is and how it works. It is easy to misinterpret what is going on and relate computer science to science, when it is actually very different. This article is especially important because we are going into a new unit that is more like math.

# John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan
John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan are computer scientists who looked for efficient structures to store data. Hopcroft is a professor at Cornell, and Tarjan is a professor at Princeton. They worked together to create an abstraction for describing an algorithm’s performance. This abstraction was revolutionary because it was not tied to the computer, instead it was based on the size of the data set. This was important because it provided a universal tool for predicting importance.
