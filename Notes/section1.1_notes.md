# Section 1.1 Notes
- The primary goal of math is to establish general mathematical truths
- Proofs establish the truth of a statement
- Every premise must be true and the argument must be valid to have a proof
- A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements
- A statement is molecular if it can be divided
- A sentence with a variable where the value is not given is not a statement
- Which truth value a molecular statement achieves is determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts
- Truth tables list what truth value of the statement is possible for every combination of truth values for the parts
- A predicate becomes a statement when the variable is replaced with a constant
