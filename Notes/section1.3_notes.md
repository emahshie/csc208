# Section 1.3 Notes
- Tautology: a statement that is necessarily true based on its logical form
- Two molecular statements are logically equivalent if P is true precisely when Q is true. This is written as $P \equiv Q$
- An implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive ($P \implies Q \equiv \lnot Q \implies \lnot P$)
- De Morgan's Law: the negaton of a disjunction or conjunction is logically equivalent to a conjunction or disjunction of negations ($\lnot (P \lor Q) \equiv \lnot P \lor \lnot Q$) and ($\lnot (P \land Q) \equiv \lnot P \land \lnot Q$)
- Implications are disjunctions: $P \implies Q \equiv \lnot P \lor Q$
