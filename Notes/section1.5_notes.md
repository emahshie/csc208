# Section 1.5 Notes
- Subset: every element of A is also an element of B ($A \subseteq B$)
- B would be a superset of A
- Proper subset: every element of A is also an element of B, but there is at least one element in B that is not in A ($A \subset B$)
- For any sets A, B, C, if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$, then $A \subseteq C$
- $f : A \rightarrow B$ is a function that assigns each element of the set A to exactly one element of the set B
- A function is injective if each B is the output for only one A
- For $f : A \rightarrow B$, if $| A | > | B |$, then the function is not injective
- Given a function $f : X \rightarrow Y$ and a set $A \subseteq X$, we define the image of A under f to be the set $f(A) = \{f(a) \in Y : a \in A\}$. That
is, $f(A)$ is the set of all outputs of the function for inputs in $A$
- Let $f : X \rightarrow Y$ be a function, and let A and B be subsets of X. If $A \subseteq B$, then $f(A) \subseteq f(B)$
- To prove one set is a subset of another, chase elements from the subset to the superset
- A relation on a set is a set of ordered pairs of elements from the set
- A relation R on a set A is transitive provided for all $x, y, z \in A$,if $xRy$ and $yRz$, then $xRz$
- To prove that a relation is not transitive, you need to find three elements a, b, c such that a ~ b, b ~ c, but a ~ c
- A graph is a set V of vertices and a set E of edges. The edges represent relationships between the vertices
- Let v be a vertex in a graph G. The degree of v, written d(v), is the number of edges that contain v, that is the number of edges incident to v
- In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even
