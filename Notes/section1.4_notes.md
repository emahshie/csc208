# Section 1.4 Notes
Direct proof: a proof that comes from carefully analyzing definitions until the conclusion is proven true

Proof by contrapositive: because a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, if you can directly prove the contrapositive is true, it proves that the original statement is true

Proof by contradiction: If P being false leads to a contradiction, then P is true
