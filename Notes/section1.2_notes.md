# Section 1.2 Notes
## Implication/conditional 
- $P \implies Q$
- An implication is true if P is false, Q is true, or both P and Q are true
- Converse: $Q \implies P$
- Contrapositive: $\lnot Q \implies \lnot P$
- Inverse: $\lnot P \implies \lnot Q$
- The contrapositive of a true statement is always true
- Biconditional: if and only if, $P \iff Q$
- "P is necessary for Q" means $Q \implies P$
- "P is sufficient for Q" means $P \implies Q$
