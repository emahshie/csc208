# 4.1 Additional Excercise 1
Suppose that the candy machine currently holds exactly 650 Skittles, and every time someone inserts a quarter, exactly 7 Skittles come out of the machine.

a. How many Skittles will be left in the machine after 20 quarters have been inserted?

$$650 - 20 \cdot 7 = 510$$ Skittles

b. Will there ever be exactly zero Skittles left in the machine? Explain.

For exactly zero Skittles to ever be left over, the orignial amount must be divisible by 7. 


650 % 7 = 6


so the least number of Skittles that will be left over is 6
