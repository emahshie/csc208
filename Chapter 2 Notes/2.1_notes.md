# Section 2.1 Notes
- A graph is an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$ consisting of a nonempty set $V$ (called the vertices) and a set $E$ (called the edges) of two-element subsets of $V$
- When drawing a graph, a dot is put for each vertex, and two dots are connected with a line when those two vertices are on of the 2-element subsets in the set of edges
- For two graphs to be equal, the vertex sets need to be equal and the edge sets need to be equal
- Graphs that are the same besides the name of the vertices are isomorphic
- An isomorphism between two graphs $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ is a bijection $f: V_{1} -> V_{2}$ between the vertices of the graphs such that ${a, b}$ is an edge in $G_{1}$ if and only if ${f(a), f(b)}$ is an edge in $G_{2}$
