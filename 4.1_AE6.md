# Addional Exercise 6
Show that $$a_{n} = 3  \cdot 2^{n} + 7 \cdot 5^{n}$$ is a solution to the recurrence relation $$a_{n} = 7a_{n-1} - 10a_{n-2}$$. 
What would the initial conditions need to be for this to be the closed formula for the sequence?

You can start by finding some of the terms using the closed formula:

$$a_{0} = 3  \cdot 2^{0} + 7 \cdot 5^{0} = 10$$

$$a_1 = 3 \cdot 2^1 + 7 \cdot 5^1 = 41$$

$$a_2 = 3 \cdot 2^2 + 7 \cdot 5^2 = 187$$

$$a_3 = 3 \cdot 2^3 + 7 \cdot 5^3 = 899$$

$$a_4 = 3 \cdot 2^4 + 7 \cdot 5^4 = 4423$$

$$a_5 = 3 \cdot 2^5 + 7 \cdot 5^5 = 21971$$

$$a_6 = 3 \cdot 2^6 + 7 \cdot 5^6 = 109567$$
