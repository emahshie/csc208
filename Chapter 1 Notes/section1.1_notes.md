# Section 1.1 Notes
- The primary goal of math is to establish general mathematical truths
- Proofs establish the truth of a statement
- Every premise must be true and the argument must be valid to have a proof
- A statement is atomic if it cannot be divided into smaller statements
- A statement is molecular if it can be divided
- A sentence with a variable where the value is not given is not a statement
- Which truth value a molecular statement achieves is determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts
- Truth tables list what truth value of the statement is possible for every combination of truth values for the parts
- A predicate becomes a statement when the variable is replaced with a constant

# Vocab
- premise: all of the arguments except the last one
- conclusion: the last argument
- argument: sequence of statements
- theorem: a math rule that has a proof that goes along with it
- proposition: a statement that is either true or false
- proof: a sound argument whose conclusion is the statement
- statement: a declarative sentence that is either true or false
- quantifier: used to quantify the variables in predicates
- predicate: a statement that contains a free variable
- logical connective: building molecular statements out of simpler atomic or molecular statements
- binary connective: connects two statements
- unary connective: applies to a single statement
- truth value: true or false, determined by the truth values of its parts
- propositional variables: P,Q,R,Sâ€¦ stand in for statements
- conjunction: P and Q ($P \land Q$)
- disjunction: P or Q ($P \lor Q$)
- implication: if P then Q ($P \implies Q$)
- conditional: if P then Q ($P \implies Q$)
- biconditional: P if and only if Q ($P \iff Q$)
- negation: not P ($\lnot P$)
- truth conditions: when a logical connective is true
